*Summary*

During a white board session, go step by step, asking questions throughout:

1. Analyze and question
    * What does the algorithm do?
    * What are the inputs and outputs (data types)?
    * Any restraints or rules?
2. Example/test of how it will be used
3. Visualize and discuss (draw it out if necessary)
4. Pseudocode the approach
5. Code
